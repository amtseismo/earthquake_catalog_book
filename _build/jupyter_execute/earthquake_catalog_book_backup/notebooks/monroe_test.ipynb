    "To demonstrate the catalog workflow we present here we select an earthquake sequence of interest so that we can demonstrate the notebooks and other tools.  We selected the Monroe, WA earthquake, a M4. that occurred on July 12, 2019.\n",
    "\n",
    "To determine which stations to use for this earthquake, I used `get_stas_near_monroe.py` to check on station availability near the event. I selected a subset of stations -- BERY, JCW, BHW, HTW, TOLT, RATT, and SP2 -- to explore further. I made a map of these with gmt using `monroe.gmt`.  Shown below.\n",
    "\n",
    "I made a rover request to obtain the data, retrieved it, and stored it in XXX. TOLT would not download.  Looking at the logs looks like the BH? was replaced a few days before the earthquake.\n"
