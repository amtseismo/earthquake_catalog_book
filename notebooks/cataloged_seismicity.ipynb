    "The Pacific Northwest Seismic Network (PNSN) and Northern California Seismic Network (NCSN) are the regional monitoring networks in Cascadia.  Both data centers report historic earthquakes in their respective earthquake catalogs.  To explore the contents of these catalogs, we download all events in the PNSN catalog between Jan. 1 1969 and the present day and all events in the NCSN catalog that occurred north of 38$^\\circ$N between Jan. 1 1969 and the present day.  Since both catalog query tools limit the size of the output, we download the data by date saving each download as a separate file.  We then merge the resulting files downloaded from the PNSN and the NCSN with the `pnsn_ncsn_seismicity.py` script, remove any duplicate events, and save to the files `pnsn_catalog.all` and `ncsn_catalog.all`.
