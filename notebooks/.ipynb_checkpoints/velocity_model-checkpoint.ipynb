    "For this study we use the P- and S-wave velocity model of Delph et al. (2021). The model was developed by first inverting for the 3D model of P-wave radial receiver function conversion amplitudes using adaptive common conversion point stacking (Delph et al., 2015, 2017) and incorporated a 3D velocity model correction. This correction merges a previously derived 3D shear-wave velocity model (Delph et al., 2018) with a 2D crustal V~p~/V~s~ ratio model. The 3D variable V~p~/V~s~ ratio velocity model was constructed using 1) the slab top model by McCrory et al. (2012), 2) crustal thickness estimates based on Delph et al. (2018)'s shear-wave velocity model, and 3) V~p~/V~s~ ratio estimates from local body-wave travel times of near-slab seismicity. Detailed methodologies for creating the shear-wave velocity model, including the dataset, receiver function computation, and ambient noise methodology, are available in the supplementary material of Delph et al. (2018)."
